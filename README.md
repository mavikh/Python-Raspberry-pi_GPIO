# Python-Raspberry-pi_GPIO
Here includes the files in which I have done some codes to work with GPIO pins of Raspberr-Pi.
- In blinkery.py, with pressing a key one LED starts blinking and as soon as button is released second LED is turned on by controlling of
  a PWM signal.
- In servo.py, a pwm signal control a servo in a way that it moves to its different angles forward and backward.
- In Adxl345.py, the accelerometer (adxl345) is initialized in sensitivity mode +/-2g, and the data from three-axis (x,y,z) is read and
   printed out as raw value as well as in m/s^2 format.
