# Python-Raspberry-pi_GPIO
Here includes the files in which I have done some codes to work with GPIO pins of Raspberr-Pi.
In blinkery.py, with pressing a key one LED starts blinking and as soon as button is released second LED is turned on by controlling of a PWM signal.
In servo.py, a pwm signal control a servo in a way that it moves to its different angles forward and backward.
